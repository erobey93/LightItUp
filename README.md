This project has three main parts, user control via website, user control via claps and the different states of the lights. The user will be able to access a basic website that allows them to switch between web control and clap control options for the LEDs. 
In either state, the user can switch between light colors, solid vs. blinking lights, or even set their lights to respond, or “dance”, to music. The web interface can set the same states, but also serves as a “switch” to allow the user to go back and forth between “web mode”, or “clap mode”. 

This project was developed using the Arduino IDE, C++, C, HTML, CSS and Javascript
